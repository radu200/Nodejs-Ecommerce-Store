### How do I create a new page?

A more correct way to be to say "How do I create a new route". The main file `is in routes/routes.js` contains all the routes.
Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see 3 or more arguments
to routes. In cases like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments
are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from
continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example:


```
  app.get('/profile', usersController.ensureAuthenticated,usersController.getProfile);
```

It always goes from left to right. A user visits `/profile` page. Then `usersController.ensureAuthenticated` middleware
checks if you are authenticated:

```
middleware is created in controllers/user.js
module.exports.ensureAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
};
```

If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the
next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on `GET` requests or redirects on `POST` requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to *Profile Management* page, otherwise you will be redirected to *Login* page.


```js
module.exports.getProfile = (req, res) => {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
```


Express.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, but for the most part you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.
If you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.

Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building
a page that lists all products from database.

**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.
```js
app.get('/product', productController.getProduct);
```

---

**Note:** As of Express 4.x you can define you routes like so:

```js
app.route('/product')
  .get(productController.getProduct)
  .post(productController.postProsuct)
  .put(productController.updateProduct)
  .delete(productController.delete.Product)
```
**Step 3.** Create `product.hbs inside /products folder` .
```html
    <h1> Hello World</h1> 
```

**Step 4.** Create a new controller file called `product.js` inside the *controllers* directory.
```js
/** GET /product**/
 

module.exports.getProduct = (req, res) => {
   res.render('./products/product', {
    title: 'My Product'
  });
};
```

**Step 5.** Import that controller in `routes/routes.js`.
```js
const productController = require('./controllers/product');
```
